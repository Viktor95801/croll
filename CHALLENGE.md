# What are those?

Those are some challenges that I inspired on making easier with the use of CRoll. The implementation of the challenges is in the `challenges` folder (of course, using CRoll).

## Should I implement them myself?

If you want to learn more about CRoll and implement them yourself, I recommend you to check out the CRoll documentation at the `croll/DOCUMENTATION.md` file. They are actual really simple problems, so it is not recommended if you're a somewhat intermediate-advanced programmer, just read some examples at `croll/examples`.
